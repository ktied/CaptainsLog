# captain's log: March

General Goals 
- BCI
- Ethiopia
- HWC
- ARAGOG

# Monday, March 1, 2021

Okay, so captain log. It's warm etc. 

issues with the full bci - it comes down to the method used to create the dipteryx/non-dipteryx points/polygons. If I use centroids for presence/(pseudo) absence I have issues with the scale of the imagery. If the imagery is 30 m for example, the centroid of the tree crown may fall in an pixel that doesn't have the majority of the tree. If the imagery has a super high spatial scale - aka <1 m aka drone - the centroid could be a really random part of the tree. It would be better to have a median or even to use all pixels as "dip" rather than just the pixel at the centroid in these situations. I'm not sure how this could be done uising earth engine exactly. I have ideas for R but this involves my stacking/imagery issues I think. It's a qwuestion of which tool is best for the job and are they all hammers etc. 

One thing I could think about is a buffer around points. Another the merging the polys and points 

Medium picture - I need to get the whole island predcitions into markdown or make them a webiste on earth engine
