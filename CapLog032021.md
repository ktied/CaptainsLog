# captain's log: March

General Goals 
- BCI
- Ethiopia
- HWC

# Monday, March 1, 2021

Okay, so captain log. It's warm etc. 

issues with the full bci - it comes down to the method used to create the dipteryx/non-dipteryx points/polygons. If I use centroids for presence/(pseudo) absence I have issues with the scale of the imagery. If the imagery is 30 m for example, the centroid of the tree crown may fall in an pixel that doesn't have the majority of the tree. If the imagery has a super high spatial scale - aka <1 m aka drone - the centroid could be a really random part of the tree. It would be better to have a median or even to use all pixels as "dip" rather than just the pixel at the centroid in these situations. I'm not sure how this could be done uising earth engine exactly. I have ideas for R but this involves my stacking/imagery issues I think. It's a qwuestion of which tool is best for the job and are they all hammers etc. 

One thing I could think about is a buffer around points. Another the merging the polys and points 

Medium picture - I need to get the whole island predcitions into markdown or make them a webiste on earth engine 

## To do
1. ~~run the drone pred in earth engine~~ 
2. ~~run the sentinel for one year (2017)~~
3. ~~plot those predictions~~ 
4. ~~email Liza~~
5. ~~email Kellner~~
6. email Joe with the 50ha or 25ha plot questions
7. email Katrin 
8. bug brendan about figures
9. ~~email the ethiopia folks~~
10. eventually fix discussion for ethiopia paper
11. ~~email Becky~~
12. ~~email the shauhin et al crowd about a new meeting time.~~

met with Shauhin
Tobi has some horrible stomach virus

So the outcome of the discussion 
- RESA and world view apps - find and begin
- Script comparing the colors and seeign how long it takes w drone images 
- see if andreas can run 

- attempting to run the planet stack and failing..... 
- bigger machine would have been a good idea 

# Friday 

styaed home mostly finished a classification and had Andreas run a bunch of stuff 


# Monday March 8 2021

Appropriated computer from lab after mine died more thoroughly than I thought possible. Laptop not coming for 1-2 months  

## To do today
or general week goals whatever

From Friday's meeting
1. oh look at the data from the headwall drones - to do this I need access to the swhared drive  
2. I don't remember

Sign on to gmails 
1. Get the stuff ready for sofia et al
