# Monday April 12, 2021

The friday meeting was hard this time. We continue to circle the question of if we buy the headwall coalign, and if we can use it the way we want to. 
 
There is debate amongst group members about the intentions of our fearless leader. Initially it appeared that the project was designed to simply ask if trees had fruit and roughly how much (abundance or yield estimations). Our meeting friday revelaed different ultimate aims. The most ambitious of which is remotely sensing the nutrients present in a pixel agnostic of plant species and structure. The fieldwork and framework for this would be different from the field plan drawn up.  I remain uncertain that it is possible to detect bonds without nod to structure, however I am not an expert. This is clear. 

My task, which I obviously choose to accept, is to reach out to foilks that I belive have looked into or considered this question - can you detect sugar without field work. My fingers itch to type a curt no, and to move on. My new friends : Gitelson? I don't know, why not shoot the moon. Maybe Susan once more. 


the other situation i must situate is the procurement of a field spectrometer. killer


## to Do

1. email Larry back - what a gem
2. ~~email or text chase~~ 
3. organize my thoughts
4. close some of these gd tabs and move them to sentences or spreadsheets (there's a sad band name for you) 
5. ~~have german class~~
6. HWCCCCCCCC 
7. do my german hw 
8. ~~find my glasses~~ 

beyond that, I have CPU by Big Boi stuck in my head. And now listening to Hamilton musical and feeling feelings 
one last time is really getting me. It reminds me of my last Robert meeting.

Put on osome cold play
