Captains Log

## met with Shauhin
we discussed classifications using Planet, drone, sentinel, and Hyperion imagery 
Costs and Benes of doing the weighted means instead of centroids for extracting data for dipteryx points. 

Overall we can make a mask 
Shauhin is going to look at the planet bands w the hyperion - and I made a list of the Hyperion bands within the ranges of the planet bands 


I will need to meet w Kristen
I would like to rerun my GSM classification for Nathan et al. SO I will view and open what he sent

To Do: 
Otherwise - I emailed the ForestGeo people for seedling data access after receiving email from stri
Rerun GSM at least one of those suckers

Cold today. figured out how to move this to git hopefully?

To Do (end of week, let's be real)
1. clean files nathan sent to add to earth engine
2. write to Daisy et al? 
3. Get the Hyperion in the classifications
4. 

learned something: about saving your R studio session info like the packages etc. 


Save the session as a txt file (readable outside R)
sessioninfo::session_info() in the terminal
Save the output to a session_info_date.txt file in your github repository
Reinstall the versions you need at a later date
pander::pander(session_info_date)

Save the session as an R specific format
> sessioninfo::save.session(file="session_info.RSession", ...)
> sessioninfo::restore.session(file="session_info.RSession", ...)
