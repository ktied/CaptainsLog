Captain's Log


CL Feb 10 2021

met with Shauhin
discussed classifications using Planet, drone, sentinel and Hyperion imagery 
Costs and Benes of doing the weighted means instead of centroids for extracting data for dipteryx points. 

Overall we can make a mask 
Shauhin is going to look at the planet bands w the hyperion - and I made a list of the H bands within the ranges of the planet bands 


I will need to meet w Kristen

To Do:

Rerun GSM at least one of those suckers
