Thisis the last day of June,. Whatever.

So yesterday I did a hack thing. My code to digest Planet data, combine it and mask clouds does a crap job if you change the file names, which the planet people have done. THey added an "SR" to one file name but not the others. I did the hack thing and deleted the addition. This is obviously not a real fix, but it was faster than whatever the F I was doing.
