Captains Log,perfect enemy of good etc etc 

## met with Shauhin
we discussed classifications using Planet, drone, sentinel, and Hyperion imagery 
Costs and Benes of doing the weighted means instead of centroids for extracting data for dipteryx points. 
- we would need to either download data or find a work around for the sampleRegions code: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-image-sampleregions
- Previously looked at cloud cover problems and masking: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aff3/3f1e89db7e4fb7297b1719c9daeb3fb33731.pdf

Overall we can make a mask for BCI and I probably should 
Shauhin is going to look at the planet bands w the hyperion - and I made a list of the Hyperion bands within the ranges of the planet bands 


## met w Kristen at 4pm
We discussed the conflict paper and agreed to work on it for 3 days next week
uncertain if we will include the vervets - they're interesting from a perspective of the psychological disconnect of feeling vervets are a huge problem. OR the distance/nuisance 
Overreporting vervets since no other problems 

We discussed her graduate student (Michael) and using the biomass surveys and ndvi.
